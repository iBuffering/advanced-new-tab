This button will add a new tab outside of any group, essentially bypassing this extension.\n\n**Changelog**\n\n_Version 1.2.2 (2025-07-23)_\n- Fixed error with action not being defined\n\n_Version 1.2.1 (2025-07-15)_\n- Added command \"newTabIgnoreGroup\" with default keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl+Alt+T\"; it will create a new tab outside any group"
